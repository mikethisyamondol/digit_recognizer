# Digit Recognizer
The purpose of this project is to classify handwritten digits based on the MNIST dataset. The first part of this project utilizes RandomForestClassifier to explore and experiment with principal component analysis (PCA) to understand the effects it has, as well as utilizing K-Means Clustering to experiment with a semi-unsupervised model.

This dataset was also used to get an base understanding of Neural Networks, playing around with different topologies and optimizers.
