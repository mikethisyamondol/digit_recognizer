# Digit Recognizer
The purpose of this project is to classify handwritten digits based on the MNIST dataset. The first part of this project utilizes RandomForestClassifier to explore and experiment with principal component analysis (PCA) to understand the effects it has, as well as utilizing K-Means Clustering to experiment with a semi-unsupervised model. Of course, this particular dataset might not make a ton of sense to use unsupervised learning, but is a good way to get an understanding.

A future iteration of this project will employ a Convolutional Neural Network to classify the digits.
